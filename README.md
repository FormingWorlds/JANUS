### Installation instructions
See INSTALL.md for steps.

### Run instructions
Only attempt to run AEOLUS after you have followed all of the instructions in INSTALL.md    
If using a fresh shell, it is necessary to perform the following steps:     
1. `source AEOLUS.env`
2. `conda activate aeolus`
Then you can run the code by running: `python SocRadConv.py`
